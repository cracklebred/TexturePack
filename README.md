# TexturePack
This is the texture pack for the City Server

These are not the assests for the mods, mod assets should be packed together with them


###Testing
To test out your texture, zip it up, give it some meta information, and put it in the resources folder.
This folder can be easily accessed by goign to options->resource packs->open resource pack folder


###For Pull requests 
please include the rendered output in game for discussion
