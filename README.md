# TexturePack
This is the texture pack for the City Server

These are not the assests for the mods, mod assets should be packed together with them

###How to add for testing

Change out the texture files, they have to be named the same as the item texture you are replacing. Missing textures will be replaced with the vanilla version

Make sure your compressed file layout has the proper folder structure, the first level should be the meta data and a folder called assets, then minecraft and then the textures.

To actually test it put it in the resource pack folder. This folder can be easily accessed by going to options->resource packs->open resource pack folder in the game menu.
